Feature: Api status
  In order to know the server is up and running
  As a health check
  I want to check the api status

  Scenario: Check the api status
    Given I send a GET request to "/status"
    Then the response status code should be 200
    And the response body should be: 
    """
    {
    "status": 200,
    "statusMsg": "Success",
    "data": "Status server: ğŸŸ¢"
    }
    """
