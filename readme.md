# 🎲 Dice Game API

⚡ Welcome to the Dice Game API, a web service designed to support a simple yet fun dice game. This document will guide you through the game rules, API functionalities, and the usage.
### 🎯 Game Rules

The Dice Game is played with two six-sided dice. The outcome of each game is determined by the roll of these dice:

If the result of the two dice is 7, the game is won.
Otherwise, the game is lost.

### 🤖 API Functionalities

In order to play the game, you must register as a player with a unique name. Each player can see a list of all the games they've played and their win rate.

The API supports the following operations:

- **Player registration:** A player can register with a unique name. On creation, a unique identifier and registration date is assigned. If a player does not want to add a name, they will be designated "ANONYMOUS". There can be more than one "ANONYMOUS" player.

- **Play a game:** A registered player can play a game. Each game will be recorded with the result of the dice roll and whether the game was won or not.

- **List games:** A player can view a list of all the games they've played, the values of each dice roll and whether they won or not. Additionally, they can see their win rate.

- **Delete games:** A player cannot delete a specific game, but they can delete all of their games.

- **List players:** The API allows to list all the registered players, their win rate, and the average win rate of all players.

The API follows the main design patterns and respects a clean architecture structure. The persistence is achieved through MySQL database using Sequelize as an ORM.

### 📋 GitHub Actions Workflow:

[![🏠 Build](https://github.com/AraManjon/typescript-tdd-template/actions/workflows/build.yml/badge.svg?branch=master)](https://github.com/AraManjon/typescript-tdd-template/actions/workflows/build.yml)

This GitHub Actions workflow automatically builds and tests the application when code changes are pushed to the master branch or a pull request targeting the main branch is opened or synchronized.

### 📥 Installation

To get started with this template, you first need to clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/AraManjon/typescript-tdd-template.git
```

Then, install the project dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```

### 🏁 How To Start

To start the server in development mode, run the following script:
```bash
npm run dev
```
Then, open http://localhost:8000 to access the server.


### 🚀 Production

To run the server in production mode, first build the TypeScript code into JavaScript by running:

```bash
npm run build
```

This will generate the dist directory with the compiled JavaScript files.

Then, start the server by running:

```bash
npm start
```

This will start the server and make it available at http://localhost:8000.


### 🏗️ Scripts
This project comes with several predefined scripts in the package.json file:

```test```: Runs tests unit and acceptance tests.

```test:unit```: Runs tests using jest.

```test:features```: Runs tests using cucumber and supertest.

```lint```: Runs ESLint to check code quality.

```lint:fix```: Runs ESLint to fix code style issues.

```dev```: Starts the development server with ts-node-dev and allows debugging

```build```: Removes the ./dist folder and compiles the TypeScript code into JavaScript in the ./dist folder.

```start```: Starts the server in production using the compiled files in the dist/ folder.
